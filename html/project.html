			<div class= "col-sm text-right"> July 2011 - June 2012</div>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Telstra projects that include installing optical fiber from its exchange to the customer’s building, terminating using COFTU (customer optical fiber termination unit) and commissioning</li>

			<div class="col-sm-10"><strong>Virtual Circuit and Packet Switching Protocol using Python Programming: Computer Network Project</strong></div>
			<div class= "col-sm text-right">September 2017</div>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>This project uses topology.txt where the topology of routers is given and workload.txt which tells what routers need to communicate,
				 to simulate the performance of circuit and packet switching in the network. It uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the most feasible path.
			</li>
		</ul>

			<div class="col-sm-10"><strong>Environmental Data Acquisition and Logging System (EDALS): Electronics and Communication Engineering Project</strong></div>
			<div class= "col-sm text-right">October 2010</div>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>This project acquires data (wind velocity, humidity, temperature and rainfall) from different remote locations using remote sensors and logs these data
				to the central server using GSM (Global System for Mobile). It also incorporates database (MsSQL) and user application for user interface
			</li>
		</ul>
